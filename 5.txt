When I placed a wreath of Norway pine on my head and began telling stories, all memory of that hard factual language melted away into the language of story. I told "The Little Fir Tree", a Christmas scene from one of Dick Gregory’s novels and the story of Pitys, who transformed herself into a pine tree to escape a marauding Pan; ever since that time, the pine tree has symbolized immortality and eternal life.

Children and grown-ups cuddled together around the stories and then trimmed the tree. The young ones fell asleep amidst the winter coats while adults sang, danced and drank glug.

Since that time, I’ve continued my path as a storyteller, a commitment which I treasure more each day. And as the years passed, I’ve come to see storytelling as a healing art.
