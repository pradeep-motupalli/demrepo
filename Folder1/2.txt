2. Precise Word Choice
Similarly, we must consider the depth of students’ vocabulary at any given stage of their education. An elevated word choice—no matter how precise and appropriate for an adult reader—will likely be lost on a younger student reader. An excellent resource for gauging grade-level appropriate vocabulary is the EDL Core Vocabularies in Reading, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. This and other guides will help the educational writer discern appropriate and effective word choice in crafting the educational fiction passage.
