3. Concise Description
Concision is especially important in educational writing for a couple of reasons. First, the student must read, absorb, and respond to the content within a given amount of time. Second, the educational fiction passage usually falls between 500 and 1,000 words, depending on the intended grade level. This limited space creates a challenge for the fiction writer, who often longs to wax eloquent in his or her prose. The key is to resist this urge and focus instead on the essential details. What does the student need to know in order to answer the questions dictated by the appropriate educational standards? Which essential details will convey the necessary information and keep the student engaged, so that the main points and objectives are recognized, accepted, and applied? If any details do not prove essential under this scrutiny, eliminate them, or recast them in ways that do.
