4. Powerful Plot Development
Each fiction passage must display a complete story arc, a beginning, middle, and end, complete with rising action, falling action, and dénouement. It is important not to distract the student in his or her detection of missing elements in the story arc. (What happened to the heroine in the end? Why didn’t the hero complete his journey?) The aim is not to trick students into discerning some hidden meaning or outcome. All elements of the arc must exist within the text, so that students may complete their own journeys in achieving the educational objectives of the passage and questions that will follow. As educational writers, it is our duty to provide all elements of this arc, so that students may travel it and reach their individual conclusions.
