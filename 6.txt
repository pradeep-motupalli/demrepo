One of the most vital, accessible, yet often unrecognized, community based art forms is storytelling. Elaine Wynne lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Stories we tell about ourselves and the stories other people tell about us deeply affect how we live. If we want to change our lives, we must first change our stories.

This realization came to me in the early seventies after I had been involved and affected by several liberation movements, including my own with the dawning of the Women’s Movement.

It was that awareness that propelled me into becoming a professional storyteller. I began writing, dancing and photographing stories and made a video tape of storytellers. Friends began asking for stories at parties and spiritual gatherings. An early event I remember was a tree trimming party. I came to the party after spending three hours in a lawyer’s office negotiating a series of renovation contracts for the clinic where I worked.
